#### emacs is saying aider file or directory not found, although using it now  

It sounds like you're having an issue with Emacs not finding the "aider" file or directory. This could be because:

1. The aider command or package is not installed on your system
2. The aider executable is not in your PATH
3. There might be a typo in how you're trying to access it

Let me help you resolve this. First, let's check if aider is installed and accessible:

```bash
which aider
```

If aider is not installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install aider-chat
```

After installation, you might need to ensure it's in your PATH. Since you're using fish shell, you could add it to your PATH with:

```bash
set -U fish_user_paths $fish_user_paths ~/.local/bin
```

Could you please share more details about what you're trying to do with aider in Emacs? That would help me provide more specific assistance.

#### Still not working  

I see you're having issues with aider. Let's try to troubleshoot this step by step.

Since you have aider installed at `/Users/mannybarreto/.local/bin/aider` but the `pip` command isn't recognized in your fish shell, we need to:

1. Make sure Python is properly installed
2. Ensure aider is in your PATH
3. Check if Emacs can find the aider executable

Let's try these commands:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade aider-chat
```

```bash
echo $PATH
```

```bash
ls -la /Users/mannybarreto/.local/bin/aider
```

If aider is installed correctly but Emacs still can't find it, you might need to:

1. Make sure Emacs is using the correct PATH
2. Specify the full path to aider in your Emacs configuration

Could you share what specific command or function you're trying to use in Emacs that's giving you the "aider file or directory not found" error?

#### aidermacs-run: Searching for program: No such file or directory, aider  

I see the issue now. The error message "aidermacs-run: Searching for program: No such file or directory, aider" suggests that Emacs is trying to run the `aider` command but can't find it, even though it exists in your PATH.

This could be because:

1. Emacs might not be inheriting your shell's PATH environment
2. The symlink to aider might not be working correctly
3. There might be an issue with the aidermacs package configuration

Let's try a few solutions:

1. First, let's check if the aider executable works directly from the terminal:

```bash
/Users/mannybarreto/.local/bin/aider --version
```

2. If that works, let's create a simple shell script that Emacs can find:

```bash
echo '#!/bin/bash\n/Users/mannybarreto/.local/bin/aider "$@"' > ~/bin/aider
chmod +x ~/bin/aider
mkdir -p ~/bin
```

3. Then add this directory to your PATH in fish:

```bash
set -U fish_user_paths $fish_user_paths ~/bin
```

4. If you're using the aidermacs package in Emacs, you might need to customize the path to the aider executable in your Emacs configuration.

Could you share your Emacs configuration related to aidermacs or aider? That would help me provide more specific assistance.

#### Still not working  

I see you're still having issues with the aider command in Emacs. Let's try a different approach. Since we need to create the bin directory first, let's do this step by step:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
echo '#!/bin/bash' > ~/bin/aider
echo '/Users/mannybarreto/.local/bin/aider "$@"' >> ~/bin/aider
chmod +x ~/bin/aider
```

Then add this directory to your PATH:

```bash
set -U fish_user_paths $fish_user_paths ~/bin
```

After running these commands, restart your Emacs session and try again.

If you're using aidermacs, you might need to customize the path to the aider executable in your Emacs configuration. Could you share the relevant part of your Emacs configuration that's trying to use aider?

#### Maybe its an emacs configuration issue, not using fish perhaps  

You're right, it could be an Emacs configuration issue. Since Emacs might not be inheriting the environment variables from your fish shell, we need to explicitly tell Emacs where to find the aider executable.

To fix this, I'll need to see your Emacs configuration file that's trying to use aider. Could you please add your `.emacs`, `init.el`, or the relevant configuration file to the chat?

Without seeing your Emacs configuration, I can suggest creating a simple wrapper script that Emacs can find:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
echo '#!/bin/bash' > ~/bin/aider
echo '/Users/mannybarreto/.local/bin/aider "$@"' >> ~/bin/aider
chmod +x ~/bin/aider
```

Then, in your Emacs configuration, you could set the path to aider explicitly:

```bash
emacs -Q --eval '(setq exec-path (append exec-path (list "~/bin")))' --eval '(shell-command "which aider")'
```

This will help us determine if Emacs can now find the aider executable.

#### See whats wrong yet?  

I see the issue now. You're trying to use `emacsclient` with the `-Q` option, but that option is only available for the main `emacs` command, not for `emacsclient`. 

The error message "aidermacs-run: Searching for program: No such file or directory, aider" suggests that you're using a package called "aidermacs" that's trying to find and run the aider executable.

To fix this issue, I need to see your Emacs configuration related to aidermacs. Could you please share your Emacs init file or the part that configures aidermacs?

Without seeing your configuration, I can suggest creating a wrapper script and making sure Emacs knows where to find it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
echo '#!/bin/bash' > ~/bin/aider
echo '/Users/mannybarreto/.local/bin/aider "$@"' >> ~/bin/aider
chmod +x ~/bin/aider
```

Then, you would need to add this to your Emacs configuration:

```bash
emacs --eval '(setq exec-path (append exec-path (list (expand-file-name "~/bin"))))' --eval '(setq aidermacs-aider-executable "~/bin/aider")'
```

Please share your Emacs configuration so I can provide more specific help.
